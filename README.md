- Hi, Iâ€™m Dennis! I wanted to create a GitHub to showcase some of my favorite projects and homeworks. 
- The projects that I am posting are from both my time at California State University Sacramento where I studied math
- and my graduate statistics work at Texas A&M University. Currently I am learning analytics, flexible regression and I am always
- looking to improve my coding skills. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Send me an email to dennisdavidleet@gmail.com. Don't hesitate! I love working on projects with all sorts of different types of people.
